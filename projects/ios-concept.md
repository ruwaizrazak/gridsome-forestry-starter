### Summary

Deer hunter 2018 is a mobile game in the shooting genre which provides hunting experience to users. The game was released in 2016 and part of the evergreen Deer hunter franchise.

This case study is about, how I looked into the **onboarding funnel,** dissected it into multiple modules, and then crafted solutions to **reduce early churn rate** in the game.

_**This case is heavily based on research and the data I used for analysis are internal property of Glu Mobile, which I can't share, hence I won't be revealing the numbers at all._

#### Problem

A huge chunk of the new users is getting churned out at the early stage.

#### Solved

☑ Identified the problem

☑ Reworked on the onboarding process

☑ Removed barriers for users which were resulting in churn

#### Outcomes and Accomplishments

* Churn rate reduced significantly

### What we started with

During my initial days at Glu mobile, I started looking at the data to identify opportunities to improvise the user experience of the game as I believe that everything related to the product from app install to customer service is a part of user experience.

As I was monitoring the data using **Tableau**, I came to notice a significant churn rate (churn rate basically means the rate of user drop) as they get into each step of the game, which triggered me to look deeper for the cause and started looking at more quantitative and qualitative data. 

### Identifying the problem.

"There is a significant churn at the early stages of the game and our goal is to identify the cause and solve it"

### Path Forward

As the game is huge with a heavy loyal user base, we have to approach the problem quite strategically, eliminating all the possibilities for any radical change.

As a start, I decided that at first I will be analyzing the stage till the first trophy hunt (Trophy hunt is terminology for a boss fight in Deer Hunter 2018) and for the second stage, we will analyze the way our multiple modes are surfaced to the users.

### Collection and Analysis of Data

As I mentioned earlier, This was a data-heavy process that required lots of data analysis, which was done with the help of Tableau, Excel, and a few NumPy functions.

We also relied heavily on qualitative data analysis as well, we used surveys and playtesting as a means of collecting qualitative data.

Once we gathered the data, I started connecting the dots. The process includes identifying the drop percentage between two points, and then breaking it into multiple stages, and then finally identifying a place where a significant drop is happening. Once we identify that point, we then move on to the qualitative data that we have to understand why this is happening.

### Design

From the data analysis, we recognized the areas which are causing user churn and then moved ahead to solve them.

#### Proposition

We proposed that identifying the pain points and optimizing the flow while avoiding a radical change in the existing user flow within the game can bring a significant improvement in user retention.

#### Concept

* Remove the pain points which users didn't like
* Let the users choose without leading them to confusion
* Test multiple variants to optimize the onboarding further.

#### Structure

Previously, within the game lots of users identified forcing as a definite pain point, they didn't like the idea of the game taking them to something different while they were trying something else, we went to fix that part.

We decided that users should feel the unlocking of other modes as their choice by unlocking them contextually.

#### Information that we needed to evaluate

Once we are ready with the design, we have to define success metrics, also we have to see which model works. For this, we decided to send this as an A/B experiment with one control variant and one test variant.
